## <span style="color:red">Background</span>

Market Segmentation is a critical component of any modern marketing mix. By identifying and defining discrete marketing segments of a target market, marketers can specialize their approaches to messaging, channel selection, seasonality, and other factors based on the preferences and attitudes associated with the demographic identifiers associated with each segment. When done properly, this leads to a more efficient deployment of marketing resources.With the advent of large marketing databases, the challenge of revenue projection has fallen on the shoulders of marketers more frequently. Using modern modelling techniques, marketers can produce prescriptive closing rates for consumers at various stages of the sales pipeline, providing financial executives with a powerful tool to use in projecting earnings.We have chosen to examine a dataset of results from a multiyear telemarketing campaign to procure new term deposits. This particular dataset provides two useful features for analysis: (1) the nature of the product being sold provides an attribute-rich profile for each potential customer, and (2) the long-term nature of the sales process allows for analysis of potential seasonal and other time-dependent effects, both of which are invaluable in forecasting.
Our primary research question is:Can effective marketing segments be derived from observing the attributes of respondents to previous marketing campaigns?
We will also research the following supporting questions:
1. Can attributes of previous buyers be used to build a model to predict closing probability?
2. Does seasonality have a substantial effect on closing, independent of time spent in the pipeline?

## <span style="color:red">Data Description</span>

We will analyze the following datasets: bank-full and bank-additional-full. Bank-additional-full has additional social and economic attributes that are not included in the bank-full data. Also bank-full has a balance attributed that is not included in bank-additional-full dataset. Across both datasets, there are 22 variables. 

**INPUT VARIABLES**

1. **age**: (numeric)
2. **job**: type of job (categorical: 'admin.', 'blue-collar', 'entrepreneur', 'housemaid', 'management', 'retired', 'self-employed', 'services', 'student', 'technician', 'unemployed', 'unknown')
3. **marital** : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4. **education**: (categorical:'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
5. **default**: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6. **housing**: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7. **loan**: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
8. **balance**: current balance in client's account (Note: this variable is only in )

Related with the last contact of the current campaign:

9. **contact**: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')
10. **month**: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
11. **day_of_week**: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
12. **duration**: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note:  this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

Other attributes

13. **campaign**: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
14. **pdays**: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
15. **previous**: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
16. **poutcome**: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure', 'nonexistent', 'success')
   
Social and economic context attributes

17. **emp.var.rate**: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
18. **cons.price.idx**: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
19. **cons.conf.idx**: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
20. **euribor3m**: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
21. **nr.employed**: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

**OUTPUT VARIABLES**

22. **y**: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')

```

<span style="color:blue"> We attempted to merge both datasets to see if there were any overlapping results. We found only a single match between both datasets when joining across several of the 22 variables. These led us to concluded both data sets are collected from totally different sets of samples and the 1 match we found was purely coincidence. We will therefore perfume some explanatory analysis on both datasets individually and select one which will help us answer our question. </span>

***<span style="color:blue">Observations from the Frequency Distribution of df1 </span>***

<span style="color:blue">**Job:** Examining the job variable, we see the major category belongs to "admin.", "blue-collar", and "technician". The job categories that are least common are "entrepreneur", "housemaid", and "unknown".</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Marital:** Major population of customers in the dataset are married, followed by singles. Divorced customers also are a large portion. </span>

<span style="color:blue">**Education:** Education levels that are majorly seen are "university.degree", "high.school", and "basic.9y". Small population of customers with an "illiterate" education level.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Default:** Large volume of customers have "no" default status, while very few have a "yes" status. We also see a small number of customers with an "unknown" default status.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Housing:** Large population of customers have a housing loan "yes", while a smaller population do not have a housing loan ("no"). We also see a small population of individuals with "unknown" housing status.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Loan:** Most customers do not have a personal loan ("no"), and some customers have personal loan ("yes"). We also see a small population of customers with an "unknown" loan status.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Contact:** We see the most common contact mechanism is via cellular phone, followed by a telephone.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Day of Week:** Final contacts occurred most often on Thursday, and least often on Friday. </span>

***<span style="color:blue">Observations from the Frequency Distribution of df2 </span>***

<span style="color:blue">**Job:** Examining the job variable, we see the major category belongs to  "blue-collar", "management", and "technician". The job categories that are least common are "student", "housemaid", and "unknown".</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Marital:** Major population of customers in the dataset are married, followed by singles. Divorced customers also are a large portion.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Education:** The plurality of respondents had a secondary level of education, with secondary + tertiary responses making up a large majority of the set. There is a small but notable amount of unknown responses.</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Default:** The overwhelming majority of respondents have no previous default in their history</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Housing:** The majority of respondents do have a housing loan, but there is also a large amount without</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Loan:** Most customers do not have a personal loan ("no"), and some customers have personal loan ("yes").</span>

<span style="color:blue">**Contact:** We see the most common contact mechanism is via cellular phone, followed by a telephone. There is a large amount of unknown responses</span>


***<span style="color:blue">Notable differences between df1 and df2</span>***

<span style="color:blue">- df1 includes consumer financial indices, df2 includes balance</span>

<span style="color:blue">- df1 includes 'day_of_week', df2 instead includes 'day', which is an integer between 1 and 31. I'm guessing this means day of month?</span>

<span style="color:blue">- df2's levels of education are less precise than df1's levels of education</span>

<span style="color:blue">- df1's 'default', 'housing', and 'loan' responses include unknowns, but df2's do not</span>

<span style="color:blue">- df2's 'contact' responses includes unknowns, but df1's do not</span>

***<span style="color:blue">OBERVATIONS REGARDING THE COMPARISON OF THE DATASETS</span>***

<span style="color:blue">- Lack of matches when merged on just a few columns suggest that these data represent nearly or entirely distinct samples</span>
<span style="color:blue">- Significant differences in the range of values is further proof that these datasets cannot be meaningfully merged</span>

<span style="color:blue">**OBSERVATION:**</span>

<span style="color:blue">1. For both Cellular and Telephone contact methods we see many outliers outside of the whiskers of the box plot.default()</span>

<span style="color:blue">2. Median for both contact methods is similar which indicates median number of campaigns is consistent across both contact methods.</span>

<span style="color:blue">1. Most of the success in campaign for the number of contacts made happens within the first 3 contacts made.</span>

<span style="color:blue">2. Looks like there is zero success after making 8 number of contacts. So it is better to focus more on first 3 contacts during the campaign.</span>

# Balance Vs Age group

# Creating age groups 
df2$age_group <- cut(df2$age, breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 100), labels = c("0-10", "11-20", "21-30", "31-40", "41-50", "51-60", "61-70", "71+"), right = FALSE)

# Now we can calculate average account balance by age group
avg_balance_by_age_group <- df2 %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(avg_balance = mean(balance))

# Lets Create a bar plot of average account balance by age group
ggplot(avg_balance_by_age_group, aes(x = age_group, y = avg_balance)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#795548", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Average Account Balance") +
  ggtitle("Average Account Balance by Age Group")
```

<span style="color:blue">**OBSERVATION:**</span>

<span style="color:blue"> 1. On an average the account balance increases with increase in age. This seems to be valid as the person gets older they get to earn/save more and have more balance in their account</span>

<span style="color:blue"> 2. The data looks like the retired community age above 50 has an average account balance above 1500.</span>


```{r}
# Balance Vs Occupation

# Let us calculate average account balance by occupation
avg_balance_by_occupation <- df2 %>%
  group_by(job) %>%
  summarise(avg_balance = mean(balance))

# Now we can create a bar plot of average account balance by occupation
ggplot(avg_balance_by_occupation, aes(x = job, y = avg_balance, fill = job)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Occupation", y = "Average Account Balance") +
  ggtitle("Average Account Balance by Occupation") + scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=2))
```

<span style="color:blue">**OBSERVATION:**</span>

<span style="color:blue">1. From the bar plot we can see that the retired, management & Unknown has the highest average balance among other occupations. </span>

<span style="color:blue">2. Lowest average balance is seen in Services & highest is seen in Occupation.</span>
